## notes from docs

## Policies

- `Policy` is namespaced and `ClusterPolicy` is cluster wide.

- Exceptions to policies can be defined in the rules or using `PolicyException`.

- In Pipelines, you can use the **Kyverno CLI** to apply policies to YAML resource manifest files as part of a software delivery pipeline.
